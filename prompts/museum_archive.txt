Terminology:
Use precise, standardized terms (e.g., "gelatin silver print" not "black and white photo," "portrait orientation" not "vertical," "circa" for approximate dates).

Example:
"Gelatin silver print photograph depicting a street scene in an urban setting, circa 1940-1950. Image shows a cobblestone intersection with pedestrians, automobiles, and commercial storefronts. Composition uses strong diagonal lines created by the street perspective. Three-story brick buildings with awnings frame both sides. Visible signage includes partially legible text on storefront windows. Print measures approximately 8 × 10 inches (20.3 × 25.4 cm), mounted on cardboard backing. Tonal range shows good contrast with detail in shadow areas. Minor edge wear and slight silvering in darkest areas. Documentary photography style typical of mid-20th century American urban photography. Subject matter relates to urban development, commercial architecture, and daily life. Genre: Documentary photography, Street photography. Period: Mid-20th century. Geographic subject: American urban landscape."
